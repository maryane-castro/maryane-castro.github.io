- Integrate Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning solutions into backend systems, including the use of LLMs, data-driven models, and automation services.
- Contribute to MLOps practices, model integration, and system reliability in production environments.



**MLOps Developer @ Domy (_April 2025 – July 2025_)**

- Worked remotely as an MLOps Developer, collaborating on the end-to-end lifecycle of Machine Learning models and Generative AI systems.
- Built, trained, and deployed machine learning models and generative AI solutions, integrating them with backend services.
- Designed and maintained ML pipelines, model versioning, and deployment workflows, ensuring reproducibility and reliability.
- Integrated models into production environments using Docker, cloud services, and backend APIs, bridging data, ML, and application layers.
- Collaborated closely with backend engineers to ensure scalable, secure, and maintainable AI-driven systems.


**Machine Learning Developer @ NUVEN (_May 2023 - April 2025_)**
- Developed an automated image detection and analysis system using Python, YOLO for real-time detection, and OpenCV, reducing processing time by 80%. The system, previously manual, now generates over 300 reports per day compared to only 3 before.
- Created an AI system adaptable to user preferences, integrating personalized recommendations with TensorFlow, Keras, and Llama, increasing customer retention and loyalty by 40%. Structured MLOps pipelines for model training and deployment, utilizing Kubernetes, Docker, and Apache Spark to ensure scalability and automation.
- Developed advanced computer vision and machine learning solutions, optimizing data pipelines with Apache Spark, Pandas, and Docker for real-time processing, resulting in greater operational efficiency. Used Kubernetes for container orchestration to ensure scalability and flexibility.
- Created custom datasets and developed AI models, language models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models using Hugging Face, PyTorch, and SAM (Segment Anything Model) to optimize specific solutions and improve the performance of applications and systems.


**Software/Machine Learning Engineer @ IFCE (_January 2023 - December 2023_)**
- Developed a digital platform for integration and automation of administrative processes between laboratories using Spring Boot, Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL, increasing document processing speed and internal organization by 50%.
- Implemented technologies such as React, Redux, and Docker to create intuitive interfaces and faster, more reliable data pipelines.
- The new solution reduced operational errors by 30% and allowed for the centralization of previously dispersed information, speeding up collaboration between academic and technical teams.


**Software Developer @ IFCE (_January 2022 - December 2022_)**
- Developed an application for managing food services at the institution, improving user control efficiency by nearly 90% using Java, Spring Boot, and Firebase, eliminating over R$ 70,000 in annual waste per institution.
- Created a solution to automate student attendance tracking using QR Code, AWS Cloud, and Kubernetes, which generated detailed annual reports on school dropout rates. This innovation contributed to retention strategies, reducing abandonment rates by 25%.
- Developed a real-time monitoring system for meals and resources, integrating data with financial and administrative systems using MySQL, Node.js, and Docker, improving management efficiency.
