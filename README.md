## Work Experience
**Machine Learning Developer @ NUVEN (_May 2023 - Present_)**
- Developed an automated image detection and analysis system using Python, YOLO for real-time detection, and OpenCV, reducing processing time by 80%. The system, previously manual, now generates over 300 reports per day compared to only 3 before.
- Created an AI system adaptable to user preferences, integrating personalized recommendations with TensorFlow, Keras, and Llama, increasing customer retention and loyalty by 40%. Structured MLOps pipelines for model training and deployment, utilizing Kubernetes, Docker, and Apache Spark to ensure scalability and automation.
- Developed advanced computer vision and machine learning solutions, optimizing data pipelines with Apache Spark, Pandas, and Docker for real-time processing, resulting in greater operational efficiency. Used Kubernetes for container orchestration to ensure scalability and flexibility.
- Created custom datasets and developed AI models, language models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models using Hugging Face, PyTorch, and SAM (Segment Anything Model) to optimize specific solutions and improve the performance of applications and systems.


**Software Engineer @ IFCE (_January 2023 - December 2023_)**
- Developed a digital platform for integration and automation of administrative processes between laboratories using Spring Boot, Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL, increasing document processing speed and internal organization by 50%.
- Implemented technologies such as React, Redux, and Docker to create intuitive interfaces and faster, more reliable data pipelines.
- The new solution reduced operational errors by 30% and allowed for the centralization of previously dispersed information, speeding up collaboration between academic and technical teams.


**Software Developer @ IFCE (_January 2022 - December 2022_)**
- Developed an application for managing food services at the institution, improving user control efficiency by nearly 90% using Java, Spring Boot, and Firebase, eliminating over R$ 70,000 in annual waste per institution.
- Created a solution to automate student attendance tracking using QR Code, AWS Cloud, and Kubernetes, which generated detailed annual reports on school dropout rates. This innovation contributed to retention strategies, reducing abandonment rates by 25%.
- Developed a real-time monitoring system for meals and resources, integrating data with financial and administrative systems using MySQL, Node.js, and Docker, improving management efficiency.





## Pet Projects
### Construction
[Publication](https://)
Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)
Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
